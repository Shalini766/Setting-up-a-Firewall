# Setting-up-a-Firewall
Firewalls play an essential role in network security by ensuring only authorised access.

The project explores the process of setting up and configuring a basic firewall on a virtual machine (VM) using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) demonstrating the step-by-step process of enabling the firewall, configuring rules to allow or block specific types of traffic, and verifying the rules using various commands. 

From this project users can gain hands-on experience in securing a virtual machine by effectively using firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic. The ultimate goal is to enhance system security by preventing unauthorized access while ensuring legitimate traffic flows seamlessly.
